# clustering

The objective of this project is to learn the different methods of clustering.
To do this, we use a dataset containing the positions of chipotle restaurants in the United States. We are trying to find the location with the highest concentration of restaurants.

## How to Determine the Optimal numbers of clusters
We use the elbow method and the silhouette method

With these 2 graphs we decided that the optimal number of clusters was 37.

## How to choose the best place to live
To choose the place with the most restaurants, we drew a circle around the centroids and looked for the one with the most restaurants.

In conclusion, the place with the most "chipotle" is xxx
